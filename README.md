DESCRIPTION:

This project involves the design and implementation of a simple synchronous RAM moduke usingverilog or VHDL.the ram supports read and write operations,synchronized with a clock signal,ensuring controlled data access.the design includes a memory array,address input,data input,data output,read/write control signal,and clock input.
        The functionality of the RAM is verified throught a testbench that simulates various memory operations such as writing data to specific addresses and reading it back to confirm accuracy.the simulation results are presented through waveform analysis using tools like modelsim or vivado.
